Given a MATLAB plot-building script, I want to extract documentation and variable usage for all plot sections. Specifically:

1. For each major plot section, defined by a prominent comment heading (for example, lines with many dashes and a title like %---- North, east and vertical velocity components plots ----%), extract the heading.
2. For each section, extract only the variables that are used as arguments in plot() functions within that section. Ignore all other code and ignore variables used only outside plot().
3. For each block, output the results in two formats:
   - A Markdown file, with each heading followed by the list of unique variables used in plot() commands in that block.
   - A CSV file (semicolon ; separator) with columns: variable;head, where each variable is paired with its heading.

Example Output Format:

````markdown
# North, east and vertical velocity components plots
t  
V_dvl_mass  
...

CSV:
variable;head
t;North, east and vertical velocity components plots
V_dvl_mass;North, east and vertical velocity components plots
...

Rules:
- Do not include variables that are only used in other functions or outside plot().
- Use only variables that appear directly as arguments to plot().
- Each variable should only appear under its relevant heading(s).
- Use a semicolon as the CSV separator.
- Repeat for all major plot sections in the file.
